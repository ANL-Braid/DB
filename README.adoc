Braid provenance system

== System goals

* Embrace automation in data analysis, retention, decision-making
* Enable users to trace back to how decisions were made
* Necessitates recording what went into model training, including external data, simulations, and structures of other learning and analysis activity
* Envision a versioned database for ML model states with HPC interfaces
* Develop recursive and versioned provenance structures:
** Models may be constructed via other models (estimates, surrogates)
** Models are constantly updated (track past decisions and allow updates)
* Integrate with other Braid components

== Use cases

=== SLAC workflow

==== Goals

. Perform data reduction at the edge
. Train models on specific characteristics of experiment-specific data

==== Workflow

. Scientist configures experiment parameters
. Workflow launches simulations with experiment parameters
. Complete simulations by time experiment data collection is complete
. Train model on simulation and experiment data
. Run model on an FPGA to perform data reduction in production

==== Provenance records

===== Notes

* Everything has typical metadata like timestamps
* Records can be updated
** Not immutable history like most provenance data
** Old versions can be recovered and used

===== Records

. Experimental configurations (independent?)
. Experiment outputs
. Other simulation inputs?
.. Software version, configuration?
. Simulation outputs
. Training data ingest
. Inference outputs (statements)
.. Could be in the form of tests
.. Like a super-Jenkins

=== BraggNN workflow

==== Goals

. Improve peak finding
. Train model to represent Bragg peaks

==== Workflow

. Scientist configures experiment parameters
. APS collects raw scattering data
. Run peak finding on raw data, label peaks
. Train model on peaks to represent raw data
. Reproduce and save peak locations

==== Provenance records

===== Notes

* Everything has typical metadata like timestamps

===== Records

. Experimental configurations (independent?)
. Experiment outputs
. Derived peak locations
. Models trained, checkpoints, etc.
. Inferred peak locations from trained model

=== SSX

==== Goals

. Track the provenance of SSX crystal structures

==== Workflow

. Scientists create a beamline.json and process.phil file
. Analysis is performed on the input data using these configs to create int files
. The int files are used with a prime.phil file to create a structure

==== Provenance records

===== Notes

. Structures can come from multiple experiments. This is defined by an intlist in the prime.phil file.

===== Records

. Experimental config files (phil, beamline.json)
. Analysis results (int files)
. Derived structure

=== CTSegNet

==== Goals

. Track the history of various U-Net-like models used for trial-and-error image segmentation

==== Workflow

. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aniketkt/CTSegNet/master/notebooks/CTSegNet_continuouslearning.png[Diagram]
. A tomo scan is obtained
. Perform image processing, contrast adjustment, etc.
. Apply (labeling) "masks"
. Run ensemble models in inference mode
. Get new segmentations
. Aggregate segmentation results
. Re-train models and loop...

==== Provenance notes

. Models are trained on inferences of previous models
. Provenance queries:
.. "What data was used to train this model?"
. Refer to TomoBank IDs for data identification scheme
. Need rich metadata for search

== Getting started

* No software beyond Python is required
  (a SQLite API is part of the Python standard library)
* See the test cases in the test directory

== Developer notes

* There is a high-level SQL API wrapper in db_tools called BraidSQL. +
  This API is generic SQL, it does not know about Braid concepts
* The high-level Braid Database API is called BraidDB
* BraidDB is used by the Braid concepts: BraidFact, BraidRecord,
  BraidModel, ...
* The Braid concepts are used by the workflows
* We constantly check the DB connection because this is useful when
  running workflows

== Tools

bin/braid-db-create::
Creates a DB based on the structure in braid-db.sql

bin/braid-db-print::
Print the DB to text

== Tests

Tests are in the test/ directory.

Tests are run nightly at:

* https://jenkins-ci.cels.anl.gov/job/Braid-DB-Core
* https://jenkins-ci.cels.anl.gov/job/Braid-DB-Workflows
