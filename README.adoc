Braid provenance system

== System goals

* Embrace automation in data analysis, retention, decision-making
* Enable users to trace back to how decisions were made
* Necessitates recording what went into model training, including external data, simulations, and structures of other learning and analysis activity
* Envision a versioned database for ML model states with HPC interfaces
* Develop recursive and versioned provenance structures:
** Models may be constructed via other models (estimates, surrogates)
** Models are constantly updated (track past decisions and allow updates)
* Integrate with other Braid components

== Use cases

=== SLAC workflow

==== Goals

. Perform data reduction at the edge
. Train models on specific characteristics of experiment-specific data

==== Workflow

. Scientist configures experiment parameters
. Workflow launches simulations with experiment parameters
. Complete simulations by time experiment data collection is complete
. Train model on simulation and experiment data
. Run model on an FPGA to perform data reduction in production

==== Provenance records

===== Notes

* Everything has typical metadata like timestamps
* Records can be updated
** Not immutable history like most provenance data
** Old versions can be recovered and used

===== Records

. Experimental configurations (independent?)
. Experiment outputs
. Other simulation inputs?
.. Software version, configuration?
. Simulation outputs
. Training data ingest
. Inference outputs (statements)
.. Could be in the form of tests
.. Like a super-Jenkins
