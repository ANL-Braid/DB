Braid provenance system

== Goals

* Embrace automation in data analysis, retention, decision-making
* Enable users to trace back to how decisions were made
* Necessitates recording what went into model training, including external data, simulations, and structures of other learning and analysis activity
* Envision a versioned database for ML model states with HPC interfaces
* Develop recursive and versioned provenance structures:
** Models may be constructed via other models (estimates, surrogates)
** Models are constantly updated (track past decisions and allow updates)
* Integrate with other Braid components
